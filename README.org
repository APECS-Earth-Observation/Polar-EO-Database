* Polar-EO-Database
The [[https://www.apecs.is/who-we-are/project-groups.html][APECS Remote sensing project group]] initiated the Polar Remote Sensing
Database during the 2020-2021 term as a [[https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/][Google Data Studio]] frontend with a
backend in the form of a [[https://www.google.com/sheets/about/][Google Sheet]].

Here, it is proposed to build upon this existing structure by considering the
Google sheet as an intermediary between the database backend, hosted here in the
form of [[https://www.json.org][JSON]] files, and the frontend created with Google services.
